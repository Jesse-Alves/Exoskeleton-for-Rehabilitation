<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Master thesis project is dedicated to research economical technologies aimed at activating upper-limb muscles through the design and prototyping of an affordable exoskeleton structure for rehabilitation and assistance, especially for people who have suffered a stroke. Extensive research has been conducted, first exploring into the medical context surrounding the illness, encompassing an understanding of its detection through medical imaging exams and its consequences, particularly
within the neuro motor domain. Then, a detailed review of rehabilitation methods, both robotic and non-robotic, was performed in order to better understand the specifications and complexities to design an exoskeleton aimed at rehabilitation. Furthermore, the project conducted an in-depth exploration of various types of robotic actuators utilized in exoskeletons for rehabilitation purposes. Through comprehensive investigation, the characteristics and applications of different actuators were examined to understand their suitability for assisting with upper-limb rehabilitation. Additionally, the concept of compliance mechanisms was introduced, elucidating their significance in enhancing the functionality and comfort of exoskeleton devices. 

### The main contribution of the present Master thesis project

This research has started at ICube in 2022-23 in the framework of a joint project with Politecnico Milano, and the current master thesis aims to propose an actuation solution based on the use of springs, finish the CAD design of the exoskeleton structure and print it, assembly the mechanical system with a cost-efficiency measurement system developed for me in the first year of the master’s degree [Project Link](https://github.com/Jesse-Alves/Low-Cost-Force-Sensing-System-Prototyping-for-Upper-Limb-Rehabilitation), and develop a control strategy to assist volitational motion in ROS2 environment. By systematically evaluating and presenting the advantages and drawbacks of each mechanism, the project provides valuable insights into the design considerations and trade-offs inherent in developing effective and parsimonious actuation systems for upper-limb exoskeletons.
